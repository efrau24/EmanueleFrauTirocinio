USER: Thanks. I guess today’s just one of those days where everything feels like too much. Too many things I should be doing, and no energy to actually do them.
ASSISTANT:  It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load right now, Mark. Can you share more about what specific tasks or responsibilities are making you feel overwhelmed at the moment?
USER: Yeah… it’s everything piling up. I haven’t called the vet for Buddy, I haven’t told my landlord about him, the car needs repairs and inspection, bills are stacking up, and then work… I’ve got closings, title stuff, and hardly any new clients. Feels like I can’t catch a break.
ASSISTANT:  It sounds like you're dealing with quite a bit on your plate right now. When things feel overwhelming like this, is there something small that helps bring some comfort or relief? Something as simple as taking a walk or listening to music maybe?
USER: Honestly… I don’t really have a good system right now. I try to just push through the closings because that’s the one thing I don’t mind doing, but everything else just sits there. I end up putting things off until they pile up even more
